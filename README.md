# DRO-Deep-Kernel-Multiple-Instance-Learning
This is the code for the paper "Distributionally Robust Optimization for Deep Kernel Multiple Instance Learning". 
Processed dataset required for the training will be provided separately in the google-drive because of the size issue.
We have evaluation on five different datasets in the paper: (1) SanghaiTech, (2) UCF-Crime, (3) Avenue, (4) SanghaiTech Outlier, and (5) UCF-Crime Multimoal.

## SanghaiTech Dataset:
